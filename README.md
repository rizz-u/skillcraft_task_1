 Task 1 Completed – House Price Prediction using Linear Regression! 
🚀 Task 1 Completed – House Price Prediction using Linear Regression! 🏡📉
Proud to share that I’ve completed the first task as a Machine Learning Intern at SkillCraft Technology!
In this project, I built a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on features like square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms.

📊 Project Highlights:
- Cleaned and analyzed the House Price Dataset.
- Achieved an R² score of 0.58 and visualized prediction accuracy.
- Interpreted model coefficients to understand feature influence/
- Strengthened skills in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

This was a great hands-on learning experience that deepened my understanding of applying machine learning to solve real-world problems. 
Excited for what’s next in this journey! 🌟
Grateful to SkillCraft Technology for this incredible opportunity!
